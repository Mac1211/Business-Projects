# Customer Segmentation Analysis
The provided Python code performs customer segmentation on marketing data using K-Means clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and Autoencoders. The goal is to identify distinct groups of customers based on their purchasing behavior and other attributes.
## Key steps and explanations:

### Import Libraries: 
The code starts by importing necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.
### Load and Explore Data:
1) The marketing dataset is loaded from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
2) The info() method provides a summary of the dataset, including column names, data types, and missing values.
3) The describe() method gives descriptive statistics of the numerical columns.
4) A heatmap is used to visualize missing values in the dataset.
5) The code checks for and handles missing values in the 'MINIMUM_PAYMENTS' and 'CREDIT_LIMIT' columns by imputing the mean values.
6) The code checks for and removes any duplicate rows in the dataset.
7) The 'CUST_ID' column is dropped as it's not needed for the analysis.
8) Histograms are plotted for each column to understand their distributions.
9) A correlation matrix is computed and visualized using a heatmap to identify relationships between variables.
### K-Means Clustering:
1) The data is standardized using StandardScaler to ensure all features have the same scale.
2) The elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters for K-Means. The Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) is calculated for different numbers of clusters, and the 'elbow' point in the plot suggests the optimal number.
3) K-Means clustering is applied with the chosen number of clusters (8 in this case).
4) The cluster centers are obtained and inversely transformed back to the original scale for better interpretability.
5) Histograms are plotted for each feature within each cluster to visualize the distribution of customer attributes across different segments.
### Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:
1) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data to 2 components for visualization purposes.
2) The first two principal components are extracted and plotted in a scatterplot, with different colors representing different clusters.
### Dimensionality Reduction with Autoencoders:
1) An autoencoder neural network is built using Keras. It has an encoder part that compresses the data into a lower-dimensional representation and a decoder part that tries to reconstruct the original data from the encoded representation.
2) The autoencoder is trained on the standardized data.
3) The encoder part of the trained autoencoder is used to obtain the encoded representations of the data.
4) K-Means clustering is applied to the encoded data, and the elbow method is used again to find the optimal number of clusters.
5) The final K-Means clustering is performed on the encoded data with the chosen number of clusters.
6) PCA is applied to the encoded data to visualize the clusters in a 2D scatterplot.

#### Overall, this code demonstrates customer segmentation using K-Means clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques. It helps identify distinct customer groups based on their behavior and characteristics, which can be valuable for targeted marketing and personalized recommendations.

The optimal number of clusters might vary depending on the dataset and business requirements. We can experiment with different values and evaluate the results. The autoencoder architecture and hyperparameters can be further tuned to improve the quality of the encoded representations. We can consider using other clustering algorithms or dimensionality reduction techniques to see if they provide better insights into the customer segments.
